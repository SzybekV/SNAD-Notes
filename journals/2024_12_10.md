	- XML, JSon, Key HTML elements, Box model, markdown - hyperlinks, tables; git questions
	- http methods, Rest API, Inheritance
- ### [[Rest API Implementation]]
	- REST Endpoints - Location of the resource.
		- Example:
		  https://swapi.dev/api/films/1
		  HTTPS/The site/API/Collection/Id
	- [[Crud]]
		- PUT updates or creates, POST will throw error if entity is already there.
		- GET to read.
		- PUT or PATCH to update, PATCH will not insert into DataBase.
		- DELETE self explanatory.
- ## [[OOP JavaScript]]
	- Benefits of OOP via #Encapsulation Reduce complexity + increase usability. Through #Abstraction Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes. Via #Inheritance Eliminate redundant code. Lastly through #Polymorphism refactor ugly switch/case statements.
	- ### [[Encapsulation]]
		- Grouping Variables and functions into an object.
		- EG:
		  ```javascript
		  let baseSalary = 30_000;
		  let overtime = 10;
		  let rate = 20;
		  
		  function getWage(baseSalary, overtime, rate){
		    return baseSalary + (overtime * rate);
		  }
		  
		  let employee = {
		    baseSalary: 30_000;
		    overtime: 10;
		    rate: 20;
		    getWage: function(){
		      return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.rate);
		    }
		  }
		  ```
	- ### [[Abstraction]]
		- Hide complexity from the outside. Makes interface of an object simple. Use classes to separate your objects. Make variables and methods public or private depending on use.
		- EG:
		  ```javascript
		  export class Vehicle {
		      constructor(capacity, speed, position) {
		          this.capacity = capacity;
		          this.numPassengers = 0;
		          this.speed = speed;
		          this.position = position;
		      }
		      move(times){
		          if(!parseInt(times)){
		              return "Must be Int";
		          }
		          this.position += this.speed * times;
		          return `Moving along ${times} times. Current position ${this.position}.`;
		      }
		      setCapacity(capacity){
		          if(capacity > this.capacity){
		              return "Cannot be higher than OG"
		          } else if(capacity < 0){
		              return "Cannot be -ve" // Negati -ve
		          }
		  
		          let pastCap = this.numPassengers;
		          this.numPassengers = capacity;
		  
		          return `Updated capacity to ${this.numPassengers} from ${pastCap}.`;
		      }
		  }
		  ```
	- ### [[Inheritance]]
		- Eliminates redundant code, use by extending existing classes.
		- EG:
		  ```javascript
		  import { Vehicle } from "./vehicle.js";
		  
		  export class Airplane extends Vehicle {
		      constructor(capacity, speed, position, altitude, airline){
		          super(capacity, speed, position);
		          this.altitude = altitude > 0 ? altitude : 0;
		          this.airline = airline;
		      }
		  
		      ascend(climb){
		          if(!parseInt(climb)){
		              return "Must be Int";
		          }
		  
		          let pastAltitude = this.altitude;
		          this.altitude += climb;
		          return `Climbing to ${this.altitude}m from ${pastAltitude}m`;
		      }
		  
		      descend(plunge){
		          if(!parseInt(plunge)){
		              return "Must be Int";
		          }
		  
		          if(this.altitude - plunge < 0){
		              return "Cannot descend that much!";
		          }
		          
		          let pastAltitude = this.altitude;
		          this.altitude -= plunge;
		          return `Descending to ${this.altitude} from ${pastAltitude}`
		      }
		  }
		  ```
	- ### [[Polymorphism]]
		- Many forms, abstract long ifs and else statements by making them their own functions to be then called in their place.
