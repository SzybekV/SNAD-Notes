		- [[Git & Github]]
			- What is the difference between init and clone?
			  __Answer:__ _Init initializes the current directory as a local repository while clone creates a directory from a remote repository and initializes it._
			- How do you check the current status of a Git repository?
			  __Answer:__ _git status_
			- What is the purpose of the .gitignore file, how do you use it?
			  __Answer:__ _.gitignore is used to specify which files/directories are to be omitted by the git while staging. Inside the file you would put the file names eg. secret or /modules_
			- How do you stage changes in Git, and how do you commit them?
			  __Answer:__ _You use git add <files> or . for all, and git commit -m "message" to commit them to a local repository._
			- What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?
			  __Answer:__ _git pull incorporates the changes from a remote repository into the current branch. While git fetch downloads objects and refs from another repository._
			- What is the difference between git and GitHub?
			  __Answer:__ _git is an application for version control while GitHub is an online service on which you can host your repositories using git._

		- [[File Formats]]
			- Describe the JSON structure.
			  __Answer:__ _Javascript object with key value pairs._
			- What datatype are the keys in JSON?
			  __Answer:__ _They are strings denoted by ""._
			- Describe the XML structure.
			  __Answer:__ _XML is where you need to specify tags for each value in <name>Matt</name> for bigger data structures you put tags in-between tags._
			- What is the difference between XML and HTML?
			  __Answer:__ _XML designed to store and transport data. While HTML is to display data on web pages._
			- Describe the structure of YAML.
			  __Answer:__ _YAML is similar to python where indents(space no tab) denote the hierarchy and structure and it is free typed with key-value pairs._
			- Why are JSON, XML and YAML used?
			  __Answer:__ _Used for exchanging structured data in software systems._
		- [[Markdown]]
			- How do you create headers of different levels in Markdown?
			  __Answer:__ _With #, the number of #s denotes how large a text will be eg. singular # biggest and ## smaller and so on._
			- How do you make text bold, italic, or both in Markdown?
			  __Answer:__ _To make text italic you can surround sentence/word with floors or use *. To make things bold you surround a sentence with 2 floors on each side._
			- How do you create an unordered list and an ordered list in Markdown.
			  __Answer:__ _You use -, * or + to denote items in the list._
			- What is the syntax for creating a simple table in Markdown?
			  __Answer:__ _You use pipes | and hyphens - to create a look of a table an d then fill it in._
			- How do you display inline code and block code in Markdown?
			  __Answer:__ _To display inline code you use backticks `` and for a code block you use 3 backticks on each side._
			- How do you create a code block?
			  __Answer:__ _3 backticks and you can also specify the language after the first 3backtics._
		- [[HTML]]
			- Outline the basic structure of an HTML document? What are the key elements?
			  __Answer:__ _DOCTYPE, root element <html>, head and body._
			- What is the difference between a tag and an attribute in HTML? Can you give an example?
			  __Answer:__ _Tags are used to indicate the start or end of an HTML element. While attributes provide additional information about the element, they have a key=value pair. eg. `<p>This is a paragraph</p>, <a href="https://Tiger.com">Click Here!</a>`_
			- How do you create a hyperlink in HTML? What attributes can you use to control its behaviour?
			  __Answer:__ _Using the href attribute on a element to press to activate the link._
			- What are the key attributes of the <img> tag, and why are they important?
			  __Answer:__ _src to define the source of the image and alt to describe the image_
			- What is the difference between ordered and unordered lists? Can you show examples of both?
			  __Answer:__ _Ordered lists `<ol>` display in sequential order(1,2,3 ...). While, unordered lists `<ul>` display without a specific order eg. *._
			- How do you create a basic form in HTML? Can you name three commonly used form elements?
			  __Answer:__ _By creating `<form>` with action and method attributes, then inside the form there are elements: `<label>, <input>, <textarea>, <button>`.
			- What are semantic tags in HTML, and why should we use them? Can you name three examples?
			  __Answer:__ *Semantic tags carry meaning about the content they enclose rather than just how they are displayed. They provide context to both browser and developer. __Makes it easier to maintain__.*
		- [[CSS]]
			- What are the different types of CSS selectors? Can you give an example for each type?
			  __Answer:__ _* Universal Selector, Type Selector eg. p{}, class selector .highlight{}, ID Selector # eg. `#header{}`, Attribute Selector eg. p [href="stuff"], Descendent Selector eg. div p {}, Child Selector eg. div > p, Adjacent Sibling Selector eg. div + p {}, General Sibling Selector eg. div ~ p, Grouping selector eg. div, p {}._
			- What is the CSS Box Model, and how do padding, border, and margin relate to it?
			  __Answer:__ _Box model is a concept of web design layout, describes structure, Padding: Space between content and border, Border: The Line surrounding the padding, Margin: the outermost space creates distance between elements border and other elements._
			- What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and sticky positioning in CSS?
			  __Answer:__ _Relative to its normal position, Absolute is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, Fixed placed relative to the view port, Sticky means its positioned based on user's scroll position._
			- What is the difference between a pseudo-class and a pseudo-element? Can you provide examples of both?
			  __Answer:__ _Pseudo class is used to define a special state of an element eg. when hovered over `button:hover {background-color: blue;}`, Pseudo element is used to style specific parts of an elemnt eg. first letter `p::before {content: "Note: ";font-weight: bold;}`_
			- Can you explain the difference between em, rem, %, and px units in CSS?
			  __Answer:__ _px is pixels, % is relative to parent elements size, em is relative to parents font size, rem is relative to Root font size._
		- [[Rest API]]
			- Json:
				- What is JSON:
				  _Javascript Object Notation, its used for transferring data between software_
				- What are JSON datatypes?
				  _String, Number, Boolean, Null, Object, Array_
				- What are other common data serialisation file types (after JSON)?
				  _XML, Yaml_
			- REST APIs
				- What is a REST API?
				  _A Rest API is a web service which allows communication between different systems using REST principles_
				- What are the REST API criteria and what do they mean?
				  _[[Rest Concepts]]_
				- What is the Importance of a layered system?
				  _The end user has no idea how actually the data is stored server side. Which prevents hackers as its  hard to make something do what you want without knowing how it works_
				- What is a REST endpoint?
				  _A link to access the API_
				- What's the relevance of plurals in the urls of REST APIs?
				  _They signify collections._
				- What does CRUD describe?
				  _Create, read, update, delete are actions that can be taken on a database._
				- What is an API Key?
				  _It is a unique token which allows you to do more operations using the API or use it at all._
				- What is HATEOAS - Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State
				  _It is the use of HTML as the application state. Client can navigate through API using links._
- ### [[Rest API Implementation]]
	- REST Endpoints - Location of the resource.
		- Example:
		  https://swapi.dev/api/films/1
		  HTTPS/The site/API/Collection/Id
	- [[Crud]]
		- PUT updates or creates, POST will throw error if entity is already there.
		- GET to read.
		- PUT or PATCH to update, PATCH will not insert into DataBase.
		- DELETE self explanatory.
- ## [[OOP JavaScript]]
	- Benefits of OOP via #Encapsulation Reduce complexity + increase usability. Through #Abstraction Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes. Via #Inheritance Eliminate redundant code. Lastly through #Polymorphism refactor ugly switch/case statements.
	- ### [[Encapsulation]]
		- Grouping Variables and functions into an object.
		- EG:
		  ```javascript
		  let baseSalary = 30_000;
		  let overtime = 10;
		  let rate = 20;
		  
		  function getWage(baseSalary, overtime, rate){
		    return baseSalary + (overtime * rate);
		  }
		  
		  let employee = {
		    baseSalary: 30_000;
		    overtime: 10;
		    rate: 20;
		    getWage: function(){
		      return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.rate);
		    }
		  }
		  ```
	- ### [[Abstraction]]
		- Hide complexity from the outside. Makes interface of an object simple. Use classes to separate your objects. Make variables and methods public or private depending on use.
		- EG:
		  ```javascript
		  export class Vehicle {
		      constructor(capacity, speed, position) {
		          this.capacity = capacity;
		          this.numPassengers = 0;
		          this.speed = speed;
		          this.position = position;
		      }
		      move(times){
		          if(!parseInt(times)){
		              return "Must be Int";
		          }
		          this.position += this.speed * times;
		          return `Moving along ${times} times. Current position ${this.position}.`;
		      }
		      setCapacity(capacity){
		          if(capacity > this.capacity){
		              return "Cannot be higher than OG"
		          } else if(capacity < 0){
		              return "Cannot be -ve" // Negati -ve
		          }
		  
		          let pastCap = this.numPassengers;
		          this.numPassengers = capacity;
		  
		          return `Updated capacity to ${this.numPassengers} from ${pastCap}.`;
		      }
		  }
		  ```
	- ### [[Inheritance]]
		- Eliminates redundant code, use by extending existing classes.
		- EG:
		  ```javascript
		  import { Vehicle } from "./vehicle.js";
		  
		  export class Airplane extends Vehicle {
		      constructor(capacity, speed, position, altitude, airline){
		          super(capacity, speed, position);
		          this.altitude = altitude > 0 ? altitude : 0;
		          this.airline = airline;
		      }
		  
		      ascend(climb){
		          if(!parseInt(climb)){
		              return "Must be Int";
		          }
		  
		          let pastAltitude = this.altitude;
		          this.altitude += climb;
		          return `Climbing to ${this.altitude}m from ${pastAltitude}m`;
		      }
		  
		      descend(plunge){
		          if(!parseInt(plunge)){
		              return "Must be Int";
		          }
		  
		          if(this.altitude - plunge < 0){
		              return "Cannot descend that much!";
		          }
		          
		          let pastAltitude = this.altitude;
		          this.altitude -= plunge;
		          return `Descending to ${this.altitude} from ${pastAltitude}`
		      }
		  }
		  ```
	- ### [[Polymorphism]]
		- Many forms, abstract long ifs and else statements by making them their own functions to be then called in their place.
