	- ### [[Rest Concepts]]
		- API - Application Programming Interface
		- REST - Is an architectural style, Not a Standard
		- RESTful = complies with the REST style
		- Constraints of REST:
			- Client-Server architecture
			- Statelessness (No client information stored on server-side)
			- Cacheability (cache on client side to have fewer requests)
			- Layered system (Client doesn't know how data is stored)
			- Code on Demand (Optional)
			- Uniform Interface:
				- Self-Descreptive
				- Hypermedia as the engine of application state
				- Resource manipulation through representations
		- Typical REST Tech:
			- Message Exchange (HTTP)
			- Describing the location, actions and target
				- URIs - Uniform Resource Identifier
				- HTTP methods
			- Representing the data
				- JSON
				- XML or HTML
			- Describe the Service
				- Swagger/OpenAPI
